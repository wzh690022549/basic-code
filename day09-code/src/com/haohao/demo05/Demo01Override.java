Method overrides the overriding considerations:
1. You must ensure that the method names and argument lists are the same between superclass and subclass.
2. The return value of the subclass method must be less than or equal to the return value range of the parent method.
3. The permission of a subclass method must be greater than or equal to the permission modifier of the superclass method.
