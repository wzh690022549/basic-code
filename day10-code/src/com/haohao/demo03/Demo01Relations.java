1. Classes are single inheritance from class to class. There is only one immediate parent.
2. There are multiple implementations between classes and interfaces. A class can implement more than one interface.
3. There is multiple inheritance between interfaces.

Precautions:
1. It doesn't matter if abstract methods are repeated in multiple parent interfaces.
2. If the default method in multiple parent interfaces is repeated, then the child interface must override the default method with the default keyword.
